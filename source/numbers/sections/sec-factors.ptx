    <title>Factors</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
      A factor is a number that can be multiplied to create a specific number in math.     
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, A group of <m>12</m> grade <m>7</m> students wanted to share <m>24</m> cookies equally. To find it out, they looked at the factors of <m>24</m>:1,2,3,4,6,8 and 24. They realized they could split the cookies into: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>2</m> cookies each for the <m>12</m> people.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>4</m> cookies each for the <m>6</m> people.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>6</m> cookies each for the <m>2</m> people.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
         Factors helped them share the cookies fairly among themselves.
