    <title>Divisibility test for 9</title>
    <p>
        A number is divisible by <m>9</m> if the sum of the digits in the number is divisible by <m>9.</m>

            Here is an example on how to find out if <m>243</m>  and <m>154</m> are divisible by <m>9</m>:
        </p>
          <p>
            <m>243 \rightarrow 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 \rightarrow 9 </m>  is divisible by <m> 9 </m> , so <m> 243</m>  is divisible by <m>9</m>.
          </p>
        </exploration>
            
    <p>
        <m>154 \rightarrow 1 + 5 + 4 = 10 \rightarrow 10 </m>  is not divisible by <m> 9 </m> , so <m> 154</m>  is not divisible by <m>9</m>.

               1. Working in groups of <m>10</m>, each learner to form a 3 digit number using numbers from <m>1-9</m>.                 
            </p>
            <p>
               2. Each student to write down their 3-digit number on a piece of paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Outside the classroom, each group members to line up holding their numbers in the air for everyone to see.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Play the shooting game where the first person in the line "shoots" (points) at everyone in positions that are multiples of 2 (e.g., 2nd, 4th, 6th,...).
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Check if the numbers from the students who were shot(were in positions which are multiples of 2) are divisible by 9.   
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Repeat the shooting game but here, the second person in the line shoots everyone in odd positions ( e.g., 1st, 3rd, 5th,...).
            </p>
            <p>
                7. Check if the numbers obtained from the students in odd positions are divisible by 9.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. Write down all numbers divisible by 9 from both rounds. Share your results with other groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                9. Discuss what you realized about the numbers divisible by 9. Were there patterns in the results?
