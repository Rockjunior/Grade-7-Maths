                <p>
                    To find the amount in solution B we substrat the amount of liquid A from the total amount of the solution.

                <p>
                    To express the liquid A as a fraction to liquid B, we have to divide the amount of liquid A by the amount of liquid B.

                        <p>
                            Now lets divide the amount of liquid A by the amount of liquid B.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <me>\frac{Liquid A}{Liquid B} = \frac{\frac{3}{5}}{\frac{2}{5}}</me>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To solve for the fraction we invert the divisor and multiply.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <me>= \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{5}{2}</me>

                        <p>

            A unit rate is a ratio that compares two quantities with different units. 
            A unit rate is a special case of a ratio where the second quantity is one.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if you buy <m>3</m> bananas for GH₵ <m>60</m>, the unit rate is the cost of one banana.
        </p>
        <p>
            To find the unit rate, divide the total cost by the number of bananas.
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>\text{Unit rate} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of bananas}}</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>\text{Unit rate} = \frac{60}{3} = 20</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, the cost of one banana is GH₵ <m>20</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mathematically, we can express the unit rate as:
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>a:b \rightarrow \frac{a}{b}</me>
            and <m>b</m> should not be equal to <m>0</m>.

                    This recipe has a ratio of <m>3</m> cups of flour to <m>4</m> cups of sugar, 
                    so there is <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> cups of flour for each cup of sugar. 
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    To find the unit rate, we divide the number of cups of flour by the number of cups of sugar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <me>\text{Unit rate} = \frac{\text{Cups of flour}}{\text{Cups of sugar}}</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <me>\text{Unit rate} = \frac{3}{4}</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the unit rate is <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> cups of flour for each cup of sugar.
                </p>

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Aisha polishes <m>8</m> square yards of floor tiles every <m>7</m> minutes, 
                    so there are <m>\frac{8}{7}</m> square yards per minute.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    To find the unit rate, we divide the number of square yards by the number of minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <me>\text{Unit rate} = \frac{\text{Square yards}}{\text{Minutes}}</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <me>\text{Unit rate} = \frac{8}{7}</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the unit rate is <m>\frac{8}{7}</m> square yards per minute.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
            In the above examples, we can see that the unit rate is a way to express the relationship between two quantities in a more manageable form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unit rates are useful in many real-life situations, such as shopping, cooking, and measuring.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if you want to compare the price of different brands of cereal, you can use unit rates to find out which one is cheaper per ounce/kilograms.

                    The table shows the weight and cost of meat at Salaga Market. 
                    If <m>3</m>kg of meat costs GH₵ <m>60</m>, use the information to complete the table.
                </p>

            <solution>
                <p>
                    We can find the unit rate by dividing the total cost by the weight of the meat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The unit rate is GH₵ <m>20</m> per kg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the unit rate of GH₵ <m>20</m> per kg, we can calculate the cost for different weights of meat:
                </p>
                <p>
                    For <m>2</m>kg: <me>\text{Cost} = 20 \times 2 = 40</me>, so the cost is GH₵ <m>40</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For <m>5</m>kg: <me>\text{Cost} = 20 \times 5 = 100</me>, so the cost is GH₵ <m>100</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For <m>12</m>kg: <me>\text{Cost} = 20 \times 12 = 240</me>, so the cost is GH₵ <m>240</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The completed table is as follows:

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Kafui, Adoley, and Jantuah shared an amount of money in the ratio of their ages. 
                    Kafui is <m>36</m> years old, Adoley is <m>48</m> years, and Jantuah is <m>24</m> years old. 
                    If Jantuah received GH₵ <m>24,000</m>, how much money did they share in total?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    To find the total amount of money shared, we first need to find the ratio of their ages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ratio of Kafui's age to Adoley's age to Jantuah's age is <m>36:48:24</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can simplify this ratio by dividing each part by the greatest common divisor (GCD), which is <m>12</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <me>\text{Ratio} = \frac{36}{12}:\frac{48}{12}:\frac{24}{12} = 3:4:2</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we can set up a table to find the total amount of money shared.
                </p>

                <tabular>
                    <row>

                    </row>
                    <row>
                        <cell>Adoley</cell><cell>48</cell><cell>24</cell><cell>12</cell><cell>4</cell>
                    </row>

                    </row>
                </tabular>
                <p>
                    The total ratio is <m>3 + 4 + 2 = 9</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Jantuah received GH₵ <m>24,000</m>, we can find the value of one part by dividing the amount Jantuah received by the number of parts he represents in the ratio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <me>2 \rightarrow 24000</me>
                    <me>9 \rightarrow x</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find the total amount of money shared, we can set up a proportion:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <me>\frac{2}{9} = \frac{24000}{x}</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cross-multiplying gives us:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <me>2x = 24000 \times 9</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <me>x = \frac{24000 \times 9}{2} = 108000</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, the total amount of money shared is GH₵ <m>108,000</m>.
                </p>
            </solution>
