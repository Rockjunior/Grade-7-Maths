        <title>Squares roots of whole numbers</title>
        <p>
            The square root of a number is the inverse operation of squaring a number. 
            The square of a number is the value that is obtained when we multiply the number by itself, 
            while the square root of a number is obtained by finding a number that when squared gives the original number.
        </p>
        <p>
            We represent the square root of a number using this symbol <m>\sqrt{}</m>. 
            For example, square root of 4, we represent it as <m>\sqrt{4}.</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            To find the square root of a number, we just see by squaring which number would give the original number.
            It is very easy to find the square root of a number that is a perfect square. 
            Perfect squares are those positive numbers that can be expressed as the product of a number by itself.
