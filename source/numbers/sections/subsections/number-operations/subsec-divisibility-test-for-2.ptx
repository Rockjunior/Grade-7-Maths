        <statement>

                Which of the following numbers are divisible by <m>2</m>?

            <p>
                To identify if a number is divisible by <m>2</m>, 
                we check if its last digit (the digit in the ones place) is either <m>0</m> or an even number <m>(2, 4, 6, 8)</m>.

                            <m>34\,436</m>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The last digit of <m>34\,43{\color{red}6}</m> is <m>6</m>, which is an even number.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, <m>34\,436</m> is divisible by <m>2.</m>

                        <p>
                            The last digit of <m>78\,13{\color{red}5}</m> is <m>5</m>, which is an odd number.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, <m>78\,135</m> is not divisible by <m>2.</m>

                        <p>
                            The last digit of <m>23\,52{\color{red}1}</m> is <m>1</m>, which is an odd number.

                        <p>
                            Therefore, <m>23\,521</m> is not divisible by <m>2.</m>

                        <p>
                            The last digit of <m>56\,49{\color{red}0}</m> is <m>0</m>
                        </p>
                        <p>

            <p>
                Hence, <m>34\,436, 56\,490</m> are divisible by <m>2</m>.
