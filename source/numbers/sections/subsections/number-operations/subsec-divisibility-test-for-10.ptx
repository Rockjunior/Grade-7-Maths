            <p>
                3. If the last digit is zero then the number is divisible by <m>10</m> and if the last digit is not zero then it is not divisible by <m>10</m>.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Which of the following numbers are divisible by <m>10</m>?

            <p>
                <m>43\,890</m> and <m>230\,170</m> are divisible by <m>10</m> because their digits in the ones place value is zero.

            <p>
                <m>51\,014</m>, <m>62\,511\,105</m> are not divisible by <m>10</m> because their digits in the ones place value is not zero.
