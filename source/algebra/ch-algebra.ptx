      Have you ever tried to solve a puzzle where you have to find a missing piece? 
      Algebra is like a mathematical puzzle where we use symbols, usually letters, to represent unknown numbers. 
      It helps us express patterns, solve problems, and understand relationships between numbers.

      <term>What is Algebra?</term>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and operations. 
      Instead of writing only numbers, we use variables like x, y, or z to stand for unknown values. 
      For example, in the equation:
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>x + 5 = 12</me>        
    </p>

    <p>
      The letter x is a variable, meaning it can change. In this case, we can find its value by solving the equation:
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>x = 12 − 5</me>
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>x = 7</me>
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>Why is Algebra Important?</term>
    </p>

    <p>
      Algebra is useful in many real-life situations, such as:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Shopping:</term> If a shirt costs $p$ dollars and you buy 3 shirts, the total cost is 3p dollars.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Traveling:</term> If a car moves at a speed of <m>s</m> km per hour, the distance traveled in <m>t</m> hours is <m>s \times t</m> km.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Problem-solving:</term> Many scientific and technical fields, such as engineering, computer science, and medicine, use algebra to make calculations and predictions.

        Algebra is a branch of math where we use letters (like <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>... ) to stand for numbers that we don't know yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        These letters are called variables.
      </p>
        <p>
        <term>Why Learn Algebra?</term>
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal in algebra is to find out what number the letter (variable) represents by solving a problem or equation.
